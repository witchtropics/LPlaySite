## Research Question

What changes can be observed in the interests of the Florida State Horticultural Society through the distant reading of its Annual Meeting Proceedings from 1894 to 1922?

# The Corpus

This research project uses plain text files of Florida State Horticultural Proceedings from 1894 to 1922. These files were sourced from Archive.org and HathiTrust. The files found on Archive.org were scanned by Archive and were generally quite clean, but tables and two column text sections suffered greatly. The HathiTrust plain text files were similarly clean.
