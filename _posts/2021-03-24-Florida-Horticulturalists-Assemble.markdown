## The data
 
For this section of my semester project, I decided to bring together and organize the member lists of my corpus (from 1894 to 1917, leaving the last two years out due to time and a significant change in format after World War 1) to see what one might glean from the lists over time. 

## The process
This was not my most efficient project, and it was certainly the most hands-on in the process of data cleaning. For this dataset, I copy-pasted the member lists from the plain text OCR files into a Google spreadsheet and started organizing the data based on the order in which it was typed by the FSHS Secretary into the original proceedings records. Getting the hang of this, I spent (too many) hours hand-cleaning and delimiting messy data into organized columns. I am certain there is an appropriate R script out there for this stage, but for some reason I did not seek it out. If there ever was a time to use computational methods, this was certainly a missed opportunity!

Also somehow in the transfer from Google Sheets to my personal computer to Github, I managed to lose two columns, creating an extra round of work. Woe!

## The results

The final (and continually updated and adjusted) dataset on the membership of the Florida State Horticultural Society offers signficiant insight into the participating members of the organization. The FSHS not only contains a number of recurring Annual members from Florida, but also significant numbers of participants from other states (New York, New Jersey, Georgia, Pennsylvania) and abroad (Cuba, Jamaica, Japan, Norway). A number of businesses are also represented (usually found in the "Last Name" column). Additional columns detailing the member's status as an individual or business could be added in the future, or their county of residence.

### Postscript
After losing the "State" and "Country" colummns, I am still updating those sections, so the data will change over time until it is fully up to date.
