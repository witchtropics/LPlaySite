##  Representing the Members and Their Home Regions

When I began studying this corpus, I expected to encounter FSHS members from all over Florida and perhaps stretching into the Southeastern United States. I was surprised to discover that individuals and companies interested in Florida horticulture spanned from Canada to Denmark to New Zealand. Deciding on how to present that data in a spatial way was difficult. I wanted to express how the member body changed over time. The linked map is a first step towards that goal, allowing users the ability to filter membership by city, state, country, and year. It is not complete, as some "Null" cell entries (particularly in the "State" column of some non-U.S. countries) may have confused the map. 

This visualization pulls from the [FSHS Membership Data (1894-1917)](https://github.com/comp-methods-fsu-2021/Florida-State-Horticultural-Society-Annual-Meeting-Proceedings/blob/0aa22fe7ea441615b9a9db20d393b2c61899daaa/Metadata/FSHS%20Membership%20Data%20(1894-1917)) dataset mentioned in prior blog posts.
